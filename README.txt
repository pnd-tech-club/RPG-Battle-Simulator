This is an RPG Battle Simulator, created mostly for my own amusement, but also serves as a learning tool for myself (and possibly others). 

Many of the functions in Version 0.0.1 are currently broken, save for EXIT. Updates will be posted randomly to my own muse (basically when I feel like it.) 

Included are two files:
- RPG A1
- RPG A1 Dev Mode

Differences are mostly based around the fact that Dev Mode displays more data and has more options. As time will go on, version types will differ more, with Dev Mode having more changes compared to the actual playable file. On the flip side, Dev Mode will be most likely be less stable than the regular file.
